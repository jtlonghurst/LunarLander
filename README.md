# LunarLander
This is an assignment I made for a Game Development class in College. The game is made in JavaScript. This game is here mostly for portfolio purposes. 

To start the game, launch the html document the way you normally would (usually by opening it in a browser). The default controls are w to engage thrust, and a and d to rotate. 
The goal of the game is to land your craft safely it needs to be right side up and going a certain speed in order to land on a flat surface. If the craft is going too fast of is 
not in the right orientation the ship will explode. There are 2 levels that will repeat over and over again. Succeeding on level 1 will get you to level 2. Failing on level 2 
will bring you back to level 1. Enjoy! 

None of the art is mine and the information of where I found it can be found commented in the code. 
Any art not referenced was given by 
the teacher and credit goes to where it is deserved.
